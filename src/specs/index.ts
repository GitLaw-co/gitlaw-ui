/**
 * Component Specifications
 *
 * This module exports design specs for all components.
 * These specs are derived from Figma and serve as the source of truth.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   import { buttonSpecs, buttonTailwindClasses } from '../specs';
 *
 * When updating components:
 * 1. First update the specs file based on Figma changes
 * 2. Then update the component to use the new specs
 * 3. This ensures specs and implementation stay in sync
